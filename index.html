                        <p>
                            Hi, my name is Graham, I started my programming journey in 2022 by attending an Information 
                            technology certificate 3 course at Tafe.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I love the opportunities to learn and grow as a person that arise from the challenges that programming 
                            has provided me with. It has taught me to think, to be creative and to understand the general approach 
                            I take to problem solving which always involves first understanding, what it is I do not yet 
                            understand.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Prior to this I had been a mechanic for 16 years, having spent most of my career working on Aston 
                            Martins among other brands such as Rolls Royce and Bentley.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In my spare time I enjoy reading, programming, going to the gym and playing video games.
                            I also have a keen interest in exploring different parts of the world and have travelled around 
                            southeast Asia, China, Hong Kong, and the east coast of Australia.
                        </p>

                                I gathered client requirements, designed, and built this project for the purpose of helping my 
                                mum along with using it as a way to learn the .NET core frameworks I will be using in my upcoming 
                                diploma course specialising in advanced programming at Tafe.

                                This project already includes server side validation however, in the future I plan to implement 
                                client side validation using Javascript to increase performance so a call to the server is not
                                required each time a form is submitted. I also plan to implement various graphs into the dashboard
                                component of the application, along with UX upgrades to the form inputs.

                                A windows desktop application that can be used to create a payslip for an employee, it reads in 
                                employee data and tax data from seperate .csv files, calculates and displays a summary of the 
                                payslip and then saves the payslip data to a timestamped .csv file.

                                This was my first project built using object oriented programming techniques, I created user 
                                stories, use case and class diagrams during the design phase of the project. I also carried out
                                reseach on the best way to overcome the task of working with .csv files which lead me to make
                                comparisons on different libraries available through nuget package manager and finally implement
                                one of those libraries into my design.

                                I gained practical skills in programming and web development by completing the following projects:
                            </p>

                                    A console login application that reads passwords and usernames from a .txt file and 
                                    allows users to create their own usernames and passwords which then get written to the 
                                    .txt file.
                                </li>
